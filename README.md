ETL of NBA Database

We will be using a data from an API from Rapid API, provided by API-Sports, from Kaggle's Basketball Database tables, and scarped statistics from Basketball-Reference.com. We want to take each table and clean the data until we have our desired data sets, and then then find a commonality between the three to merge databases for analysis.
